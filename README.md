# Sprint 3 – AI in Cybersecurity Mentorship Project

This repository documents my **Sprint 3 project** at **CSU Monterey Bay**, where I explored how AI and automation are transforming blue-team defense and SOC operations.

## 📘 Overview
Through mentorship, outreach, and event participation, I connected with cybersecurity professionals and learned how AI enhances, not replaces, human decision-making in security.

## 🧠 Key Components
- **Professional Outreach:** LinkedIn engagement and direct outreach to cybersecurity mentors.
- **Mentorship Interview:** 45-minute Google Meet conversation with *Farzan Karimi* (Sr. Director, Offensive Security @ Moderna).
- **Industry Event:** WiCyS × Cisco – *Powering Possibility: How AI Transforms Cybersecurity*.
- **Reflection Report:** Analysis of how AI, ethics, and human oversight shape modern cybersecurity defense.

## 🧩 Next Steps
- Complete Google AI & Cybersecurity certification.
- Build an **AI Log Anomaly Detector** in Python.
- Apply for 2025 internships (NVIDIA, HP, LLNL, Cisco, Splunk, Palo Alto Networks).
